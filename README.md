# cms-blog-site

## User Story
AS A developer who writes about tech
I WANT a CMS-style blog site
SO THAT I can publish articles, blog posts, and my thoughts and opinions

## Description
This application is a simple blgo website that allows users to sign up and view their own, and other peoples blog posts. When they first enter the site, they are greeted with a home page that displays all of the latest posts.

Once a user logs in, they are able to comment on others posts, create, edit and delete their own posts, and view other posts.

The design is not optimal, as the main focus was on the functionality.
